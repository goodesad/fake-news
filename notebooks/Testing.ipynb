    "text = 'A humble backyard in the central Portugal city Pombal doesn’t sound like the kind of place where history is written. And yet, an international research team is hard at work at this site studying what may very well be fossils of the largest dinosaur species ever unearthed in Europe. The remains are believed to belong to a species of sauropod, a dinosaur that could grow to 12 meters in height and 25 meters in length. Building on bones The fossils were first discovered in 2017, when a local was carrying out a building project on his property in Pombal. While the work was underway, he noticed the fossils buried in his yard, and contacted the researchers. Excavation work at the site started the next year. In August of this year, these efforts finally yielded full fossils. So far, archeologists have unearthed a set of vertebrae and ribs, judging from which the specimen was a sauropod in the group Brachiosauridae, the researchers believe. This group of dinosaurs lived from the Upper Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous (160-100 million years ago), and stand out through their well-developed forelimbs. They were herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and long tails, that walked on all fours. “It is not usual to find all the ribs of an animal like this, let alone in this position, maintaining their original anatomical position. This mode of preservation is relatively uncommon in the fossil record of dinosaurs, in particular sauropods, from the Portuguese Upper Jurassic”, says Elisabete Malafaia, Postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (Ciências ULisboa), Portugal, in a press release.The team adds that the preservation quality of the bones found so far, as well as their relative positions, makes it very likely that there is more to this skeleton that hasn’t yet been discovered. As such, they plan on continuing their excavation campaigns in the following years. The preservation characteristics of the fossils and their disposition indicate the possible presence of other parts of the skeleton of this individual, a hypothesis that will be tested in future excavation campaigns in the deposit. “The research in the Monte Agudo paleontological locality confirms that the region of Pombal has an important fossil record of Late Jurassic vertebrates, which in the last decades has provided the discovery of abundant materials very significant for the knowledge of the continental faunas that inhabited the Iberian Peninsula at about 145 million years ago”, Malafaia adds.'"

    "text = 'Ukraines military claims to have broken through Russias first line of defence in the occupied Kherson region. The reported push appears to form part of a long-awaited offensive being launched by Kyiv in an attempt to retake the countrys south. It follows weeks of Ukrainian attacks aimed at cutting off Russian forces there from main supply routes. Russias military has not commented on Ukraines claim, but one official said this was \"yet another fake\". \"Ukrainian formations are suffering severe losses both in the south and in all other directions,\" said Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-installed head of Crimea - Ukraines southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. The claims by both Ukraine and Russia have not been independently verified. Russia has occupied large swathes of Ukraines Kherson region since its invasion began on 24 February. On Monday, Ukraines Kakhovka operational group in the south said that one regiment of Russian-backed forces had left its positions in the Kherson region. It added that Russian paratroopers providing the back-up had fled the battlefield. Ukraines Hromadske TV said three of its sources in Ukraines military confirmed that the first line of defence had been broken. Meanwhile, Ukrainian army spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk said \"any military operation requires silence regime\", urging Ukrainians to be patient. \"Our main efforts have been focused on destroying the enemys ammunition storage bases. More than 10 of such bases were destroyed over the past week,\" she said. But Ms Humeniuk refused to give any further details. In a Telegram post the Ukrainian military also claimed on Monday to have struck multiple targets in the region, including a factory in Beryslav and a Russian army post by the North Crimean Canal. Kyiv officials claim to have used US-supplied Himars rocket systems to destroy three bridges crossing the Dnipro River, strikes it said would cut the Russian forces occupying Kherson off from weapons and troop reinforcements. According to Western military sources, Kyivs strikes on the river crossings are part of a targeted effort to isolate Russian troops on the right (western) bank of the river with the ultimate goal of recapturing the entire Kherson region. Moscow relied on the bridges to resupply their troops stationed west of the Dnipro river, who are now at risk of becoming isolated from the rest of Russias occupying forces. Russian outlets also reported on Monday that Ukraine had struck targets in the Kherson region - but reported that the strikes had focused on civilian infrastructure. Moscow-appointed regional official Vladimir Leontyev claimed on Monday that Ukrainian forces had shelled a hydropower plant and floodway in the Kherson city of Novaya Kakhovka, according to Russias TASS news agency. Its forces also claimed to have shot down three ballistic missiles and 21 rockets reportedly fired by Ukrainian forces. Image shows map of Kherson region. Russia captured the city of Kherson and its surrounding region with relatively little resistance in the early days of the invasion. The southern city, which had a population of 290,000 before the war, is the only regional capital to have been taken by Russian forces and is currently administered by Moscow-backed officials. According to Russias Tass news agency, officials in Kherson city have started moving forward with plans to hold a referendum on formally joining Russia, prompting accusations by the US that Russia could be preparing to illegally annex parts of occupied southern Ukraine. Last month Russia said its military focus was no longer only on eastern Ukraine but on its southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia too. 2px presentational grey line. Analysis by BBCs Hugo Bachega in Kyiv. Ukraine has long been expected to launch a major offensive to retake Kherson. We could be seeing the beginning of it, although any operation is unlikely to be easy. Kherson has been under occupation since the early days of the war, and its one of the largest Ukrainian cities in Russian hands. For weeks, Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian positions deep inside captured territory, away from the front lines. Its only been possible because of the sophisticated weapons supplied by the West - and its having a destabilising effect on the invading forces. The conflict seems to be at a deadlock, with neither side making significant gains. This could be about to change. 2px presentational grey line. In a separate development on Monday, Russian-installed officials in the Zaporizhzhia region claimed that a Ukrainian missile strike punched a hole in the roof of a fuel depot at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The claim has not been independently verified. In recent weeks, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling Europes biggest nuclear station, which was seized by Russia in early March. Moscow has kept Ukrainian personnel to operate the station. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the world narrowly avoided a radiation accident at the plant, blaming Moscows actions for this. An inspection team from the UN nuclear watchdog is expected to arrive at the plant later this week, the organisations head says.'"
